# 🧠 Nand2Tetris – From NAND Gates to a Working Computer

This repository contains my full implementation of the [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) course, completed independently before my first year of Electrical Engineering at the University of Waterloo.

The course walks through the entire construction of a modern computer system from the ground up — starting with a single NAND gate and ending with a fully functional operating system and high-level applications.

## 🧩 What I Built

- 🧱 **Logic Gates & ALU** – Implemented basic gates, multiplexers, and a 16-bit ALU in HDL  
- 🧠 **CPU & Memory** – Designed RAM modules, registers, and a CPU capable of executing binary programs  
- ⚙️ **Assembler** – Translates Hack assembly language into binary machine code  
- 🔁 **VM Translator** – Converts stack-based virtual machine code into Hack assembly  
- 🏗️ **Compiler** – Built a Jack-to-VM compiler from scratch (tokenizer, parser, code generator)  
- 🖥️ **Operating System** – Implemented core OS libraries: Math, String, Array, Output, Keyboard  
- 🎮 **Applications** – Developed programs in Jack including Pong, Text Editor, and more

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **HDL (Hardware Description Language)** – for hardware simulation  
- **Hack Assembly Language** – custom low-level language used by the CPU  
- **Python/Java** – used in building assembler, VM translator, and compiler  
- **Jack Language** – high-level, object-based programming language created for the course  
- **Nand2Tetris Software Suite** – CPU emulator, hardware simulator, VM emulator
